            "introduction": "Hello, let me introduce myself. My full name is Jeremías Nicolás Guedes Mendes, and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina, or as I like to call it, the southern civilization (a nod to Santi Siri).\nIn late 2022/early 2023, I started exploring and delving into the world of programming and software development after assembling my first PC by purchasing individual components (it started up on the first try :) ).\nCurrently, I don't have much experience in the field apart from some landing pages and personal projects; but I learn quickly. At the beginning of the year, I didn't even know what an HTML file was, and now I'm learning backend development with Node.js and MongoDB.\nI dare say that I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, SASS, GIT, JavaScript, and React JS; and as I mentioned, I'm learning Node.js, MongoDB, and Express JS through CODERHOUSE. I'm also enrolled in the Big Data/Data Analytics course at Codo a Codo (a government program), and I have some knowledge of Python from YouTube.\nIn the future, I'd like to master both relational and non-relational databases (like MongoDB and MySQL), have strong Python skills to delve into the world of artificial intelligence (in fact, I'm taking the entrance exam for the Bachelor's Degree in Data Science at UBA XXI, specifically focusing on neural networks and artificial intelligence). I'd also like to explore weakly-typed languages, most likely Go, to eventually work on backend development with that language.\nI consider myself a technology enthusiast; I love staying up to date with all the latest trends and constantly learning. I'm a self-taught individual, and much of what I know in life comes from YouTube and the internet in general. During the pandemic, I challenged myself to finally learn English after years of private lessons with little progress. I watched between three to four hours of native English videos daily (initially not understanding anything at all), and by the end of the pandemic, I could understand everything I watched without any issues. Now, I'm learning German 100% on my own, taking it very slowly, but after a year, I can already understand the general context of German videos and read simple texts (I believe that at this rate, in one more year, I'll be able to say that I understand German :)."
